the general answer is something in online video. snackfeed is a project in its early stages to help users create video channels:
<blockquote>
	snackfeed is an exciting new way to enhance your presence on the web! Have you ever dreamed of hosting your own TV show? Do you want to be the next web video celebrity? snackfeed enables you to create your own channel of TV shows, music videos or web clips and share it with the world.

so our thinking here; there is soooo (yes, the extra o's are for effect) much online video how are people every going to find what they want to watch. well people are going to find it for them. we know that this is not
a new idea by any means, but our goal is (through as steady process of evolution) is to build a site that does this in a simple, social and personal way (and easy for the generally lazy - i.e us and our friends).
